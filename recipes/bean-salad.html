    <p>
        This salad recipe is great for summer picnics. It's delicious, quick, and easy to 
        <br>quick, and easy to make. You can substitute the variety of beans in this recipe with other types and
        <br>still have a great bean salad. I sometimes use cannellini beans in place of the
        <br>green beans and it still tastes great!
