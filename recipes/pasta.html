        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. <br>
             basil bunch by the stems and dip basil leaves in boiling water until bright green,<br>
            about 2 seconds. Immediately immerse basil in ice water for several minutes <br>
            until cold to stop the cooking process. Once the basil is cold, drain well.<br>
            Remove basil leaves from stems and discard stems.</li>
        
        <br>
        <li>Blend basil leaves, 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup olive oil,<br>

        <br>
        <li>Stir fettuccine into the same pot of boiling water,<br> 
            bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through <br>
             but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.<br>
            Cook and stir leek and green onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes.<br> 
            Add jalapeno and salt; cook and stir until jalapeno is soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Stir 2 cups chicken broth, zucchini, sugar snap peas, <br>
             and English peas into jalapeno mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.<br> 
             Add asparagus and continue cooking until asparagus is soft, about 3 minutes more.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup basil-garlic mixture into zucchini mixture and cook and stir until heated through,<br> 
             about 1 minute. Remove from heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place pasta in a large bowl; pour zucchini mixture over pasta and pour remaining basil-garlic<br> 
            mixture over the zucchini mixture. Spread Parmesan cheese over the top. Toss mixture briefly to <br>
            combine and tightly wrap bowl with aluminum foil. Let stand until pasta and vegetables soak up most<br>
             of the juices and oil, about 5 minutes. Toss again.</li>
    </ol>
